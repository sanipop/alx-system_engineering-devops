Issue Summary:
Duration: The Great Authentication Blackout struck on April 14, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC), leaving users in the dark.
- Impacts The backend service took an unexpected coffee break, leaving 75% of users locked out of their accounts. Users experienced the frustration of being denied access to their digital kingdom.

Timeline:
10:00 AM: The alarm bells rang as monitoring alerts screamed about authentication failures, prompting engineers to rush to their battle stations.
10:05 AM: Armed with keyboards and determination, engineers embarked on a quest to vanquish the gremlins plaguing the system, suspecting a potential database dragon lurking in the shadows.
10:20 AM: The hunt for the elusive database dragon led to dead ends, with engineers scratching their heads and wondering if they should have brought a map.
10:40 AM: In a plot twist worthy of a mystery novel, the investigation took a detour into the realm of conspiracy theories, with whispers of a nefarious bot army overwhelming the defenses.
11:00 AM: As panic threatened to ensnare the kingdom, the brave engineers called upon the mighty backend team for reinforcements, hoping to uncover the truth behind the mystery.
11:30 AM: With the clock ticking and the pressure mounting, a breakthrough emerged from the depths of the code, revealing a mischievous bug lurking in the shadows of a recent deployment.
12:00 PM: Victory was claimed as the bug was squashed, the faulty code rolled back, and the backend services resurrected from their digital slumber.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The mischievous bug, disguised as a harmless line of code, infiltrated the kingdom during a recent deployment, wreaking havoc on authentication processes.
Resolution: The bug met its demise as the faulty code was banished, and the kingdom's defenses were reinforced, ensuring the safety of user access.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
  - Strengthen the fortress walls with enhanced code review processes to repel future invaders.
  - Deploy automated knights to patrol the kingdom's borders, ensuring the safety of authentication pathways.
  - Enchant monitoring spells to detect anomalies and thwart the schemes of mischievous bugs.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
  1. Summon the council of wise elders to conduct a thorough review of deployment processes and fortify defenses against rogue code.
  2. Forge alliances with the testing guild to establish rigorous protocols for code verification and validation before deployment.
  3. Enlist the aid of mystical wizards to craft powerful spells of monitoring and logging, providing insights into the kingdom's inner workings.
  4. Train the knights of the backend order in the art of swift rollback maneuvers, ensuring swift response to future threats.
  5. Convene a grand assembly to reflect upon the lessons learned from the Great Authentication Blackout and chart a course towards a brighter, bug-free future.

May the kingdom's digital realm remain secure and the users' access forever unimpeded!
