**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** The outage occurred on April 14, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC).
- **Impact:** The backend service responsible for user authentication and authorization experienced a complete outage, affecting 75% of active users. Users were unable to log in or access restricted content during the outage.

**Timeline:**
- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed authentication attempts.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential database failure.
- **10:20 AM:** Initial investigation focused on database performance and connectivity issues.
- **10:40 AM:** Misleading investigation path pursued, believing the database was overwhelmed by increased traffic.
- **11:00 AM:** Incident escalated to the backend engineering team as the root cause remained unidentified.
- **11:30 AM:** Through extensive debugging, it was discovered that a recent code deployment introduced a bug causing authentication requests to fail.
- **12:00 PM:** The issue was resolved by rolling back the faulty code deployment and restarting the affected services.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a bug introduced in a recent code deployment, leading to authentication failures.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by rolling back the faulty code deployment to the previous stable version and restarting the affected backend services.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen code review processes to catch potential bugs before deployment.
  - Implement automated testing for critical functionalities such as authentication and authorization.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect anomalies in authentication traffic in real-time.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Conduct a thorough review of the code deployment process to identify weaknesses.
  2. Implement stricter testing protocols for new code changes, particularly those impacting core functionalities.
  3. Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to provide better insights into system behavior during outages.
  4. Develop a rollback strategy for rapid response to critical issues arising from code deployments.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to analyze the outage response process and identify areas for improvement.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future and ensure the reliability and stability of our backend services.
